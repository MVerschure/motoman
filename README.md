## Contents

Direct ROS 2 port of all non-experimental robot support packages.

These packages are compatible with ROS 2 Foxy and newer.


## Changes wrt ROS 1 versions

Launch files are not yet provided.

The various `joint_names_...yaml` files are also no longer included, as those are not needed (they were only used by `motoman_driver`, which is no longer used).


## Changes wrt ROS2 version
Added inertial tag for the gp25. Filled with dummy values.

## Building

`git clone` the repository into a ROS 2 Colcon workspace.

Use `rosdep install -i --from-paths /path/to/colcon_ws/src/motoman` to install dependencies. 

Build the workspace.

Activate the workspace by `source`-ing the correct version of `(local_)setup.(ba)sh`.
